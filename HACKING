CODE STYLE
----------

Please use the style used by the rest of the code. Among other things,
this means:

    * 8 spaces for indentation. Note that tabs are still found in the codebase.

    * Put spaces:
        * around binary operators
        * between if/while/for/switch and "("
        * between function name and "("
     	* between ")" and "{"
        * after ","

    * if/for/while bodies:

        * Single-line bodies should (a) be on their own line, and (b)
          not have braces around them

        * Multi-line bodies should have braces around them, even if
          the body is only a single statement and the braces are not
          syntactically necessary.

        * Eg:

            for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
                if (find (i, something))
                    break;
                else {
                    function_with_big_name (i, something,
                                            something_else);
                }
            }

    * Do not use gint, gchar, glong, and gshort. (Other g-types, such
      as gpointer and the unsigned types are fine.)

    * There is a clang-format config file that can be used on new code.
      Avoid reformatting entire files.

CORRECTNESS
-----------

    * libsoup builds with lots of -W options by default, and should
      not print any warnings while compiling.

    * There are a number of regression tests in the tests/ directory.
      Running "ninja test" will run all of them (or at least, all of
      the ones that it can run based on what software you have
      installed. Eg, some tests require apache to be installed.) You
      should run "ninja test" before submitting a patch that could
      potentially change libsoup's behavior. If you are
      making extensive changes, or changing very low-level functions,
      you may want to install all of the optional pieces so you can
      run all of the regression tests.)
